# Costume Core Work Types

based on Rights Statements

An Omeka S module to allow users to easily select terms for costume work types from a drop down list of standardized vocabulary aggregated as a part of the Costume Core Toolkit, mainly using terms from the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus, Europeana Fashion Thesaurus, and Wikidata. 

The module adds a "CostumeCoreWorkTypes" data type. To use it, assign it as the
data type for a Property (i.e., Costume Core Work Type) for a Resource Template.

When the "Costume Core Work Type" type is used on a property, the UI for that
property becomes a drop-down with the appropriate terms
for the user to select. Both the human-readable name and the linked data URI
for the selected statement are applied to the item.
